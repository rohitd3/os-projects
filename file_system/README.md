# File System

## Overview
This folder contains a Go program labeled `project1.go` that is designed and implements an emulation of a File System. In order to run, simply include an input.txt file in the same directory as the `project1.go` file and it will create output into an output.txt file.

### How to Run
To run the program, use one of the following methods in your terminal:

**Option 1: Compile and run separately**
```
go build project1.go
./project1
```

**Option 2: Run directly**
```
go run project1.go
```

No additional input is needed from the terminal. The input file name `input.txt` is already specified within the program.
